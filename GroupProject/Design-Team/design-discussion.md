Very good broad overview of the wordgame application. Details lack a bit and could use couple more classes. 

It would be worth articulating the enterWord() method as it is listed as one of the requirements. For example, I added some boolean to see if the word is a certain length. 

There is no information on what the board will consist of. Vowels, weights, letter ‘Qu’, or the size. Would like to see some more classes articulating this work. Aggregation of board can be classes letters and word.
