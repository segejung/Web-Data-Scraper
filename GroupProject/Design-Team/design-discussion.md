Roger:
    Pros: Well structured, listed both UI and the classes

## Design 3

Roger:
    Pros: The classes contained all necessary fields/methods.
    Cons: The classes are interconnected so the structure is not as clear.

## Design 4

Roger:
    Pros: The design is simple, easy to read.
    Cons: The arrows are a little bit confusing. For example, which line does "minus 5 points" belong to?
